# Rclone Copy ChRIS Plugin _Template_

This repository provides source code which can be built
into a _ChRIS_ *fs*-type plugin which uses `rclone copy`
to retrieve files from a remote. 

This repository itself is not a _ChRIS_ plugin. When it
is built, the rclone config (remote configuration and
authentication) is built into the image.
